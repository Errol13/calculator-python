# Python Calculator ðŸ§®

A simple calculator program written in Python that performs basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

This project demonstrates my ability to write clean Python code and use Pytest for automated unit testing.

## Features
- CLI input for numbers and operations
- Handles division by zero gracefully
- Unit tested using `pytest`
- Added unit testing for all functions
- Added `pytest parametrize` and `pytest fixture` usages


## Run the Calculator and Pytest

### Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install project dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the python calculator

python3 calculator.py
```

### Run the test
